Given a string line1 and a string line2 which is line1 reversed with some replaced characters, output the amount of characters that have been replaced.

For example, for:
line1 = 'Hello world!'
line2 = '!dlqow olfeH'

line2 is line1 reversed but with the first l from 'Hello' and the r from 'world!' replaced. The expected output is 2.
